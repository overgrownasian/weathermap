###
### [meta]
###
### Controls the parameters for the Raft consensus group that stores metadata
### about the InfluxDB cluster.
###
[meta]
  # Where the metadata/raft database is stored
  dir = "/var/lib/influxdb/meta"

###
### [data]
###
### Controls where the actual shard data for InfluxDB lives and how it is
### flushed from the WAL. "dir" may need to be changed to a suitable place
### for your system, but the WAL settings are an advanced configuration. The
### defaults should work for most systems.
###
[data]
  # The directory where the TSM storage engine stores TSM files.
  dir = "/var/lib/influxdb/data"

  # The directory where the TSM storage engine stores WAL files.
  wal-dir = "/var/lib/influxdb/wal"

  # The size of the internal cache used in the TSI index to store previously 
  # calculated series results. Cached results will be returned quickly from the cache rather
  # than needing to be recalculated when a subsequent query with a matching tag key/value 
  # predicate is executed. Setting this value to 0 will disable the cache, which may
  # lead to query performance issues.
  # This value should only be increased if it is known that the set of regularly used 
  # tag key/value predicates across all measurements for a database is larger than 100. An
  # increase in cache size may lead to an increase in heap usage.
  series-id-set-cache-size = 100

###
### [coordinator]
###
### Controls the clustering service configuration.
###
[coordinator]
  # The default time a write request will wait until a "timeout" error is returned to the caller.
  write-timeout = "30s"

  # The maximum time a query will is allowed to execute before being killed by the system.  This limit
  # can help prevent run away queries.  Setting the value to 0 disables the limit.
  query-timeout = "10m"

  # The time threshold when a query will be logged as a slow query.  This limit can be set to help
  # discover slow or resource intensive queries.  Setting the value to 0 disables the slow query logging.
  log-queries-after = "15s"

###
### [shard-precreation]
###
### Controls the precreation of shards, so they are available before data arrives.
### Only shards that, after creation, will have both a start- and end-time in the
### future, will ever be created. Shards are never precreated that would be wholly
### or partially in the past.
[shard-precreation]
  # Determines whether shard pre-creation service is enabled.
  enabled = true

###
### [http]
###
### Controls how the HTTP endpoints are configured. These are the primary
### mechanism for getting data into and out of InfluxDB.
###
[http]
  # Determines whether HTTP endpoint is enabled.
  enabled = true

  # Determines whether the Flux query endpoint is enabled.
  flux-enabled = true

  # Determines whether the Flux query logging is enabled.
  flux-log-enabled = false

  # The bind address used by the HTTP service.
  bind-address = ":8086"

  # Determines whether user authentication is enabled over HTTP/HTTPS.
  auth-enabled = true

  # Determines whether HTTP request logging is enabled.
  log-enabled = false
